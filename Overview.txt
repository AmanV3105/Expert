                                                                                                                              Overview Of page 

1. First of All I initiated The react js app by this command - npx create-react-app sample

2. Now according to the page content I created the folder named component , in which There are 1 CSS and 3 Js files , one for navbar , one for middle content ,
    one for data cards . 

3. For navbar and middle content we have index.css . 

4. For data cards we have App.css and index.js .

5. For data cards i randomly searched for Api and I got github users Api link which i fetched using Js to create the data cards . 

6. I have imported Several images in  src folder which i used in page .

7.  I have also created build folder for static page.

8.  Unfortunately I haven't made page responsive but it can be made responsive by using media Query separately for mobile and  tablet  devices .

9.  We can import media query by this command -> npm install --save media-query-react

10. Or in place of Css files, we can use style  ={{ }} command within reactjs file itself.
